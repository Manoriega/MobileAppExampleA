# MobileAppExampleA
This is a mobile app model I made to show what I can do. I designed the user interface with 
Figma. this simple app is made in react-native. It took less than 6 hours to develop. 

##  Progress
The main process in the development of this application was:

    1. Sitemap
    2. Wireframe
    3. UI Layout creation
    4. Mockup
    5. Programming
